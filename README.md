# Grey6502

A 6502 processor emulator created using Rust.\
This is just a hobby project and there are some dumb things I'm doing in places.\
Specific ones include using an i16 for memory so I don't have to deal with subtraction stuff.\
My first time using macro's, not entirely sure it's necessary here.
